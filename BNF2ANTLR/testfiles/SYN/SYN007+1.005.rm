% Status   : Theorem
% Rating   : ? v2.0.0
% Syntax   :

% Comments : The number of distinct letters in U-N is N. The number of
%            occurrences of sentence letters in 2N. The number of clauses
%            goes up dramatically as N increases, but I don't think it
%            shows that the problems are dramatically more difficult as N
%            increases. Rather, it's that the awkward clause form
%            representation comes to the fore most dramatically with
%            embedded biconditionals. On all other measures of complexity,
%            one should say that the problems increase linearly in
%            difficulty. Urquhart says that the proof size of any resolution
%            system increases exponentially with increase in N.
%          : This problem can also be done in terms of graphs, as described
%            in [Pel86] Problem 74.
